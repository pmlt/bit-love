bit-love
========

This is a marriage proposal in the form of a Nintendo Entertainment System program. It runs on a NES emulator and a real NES console.

Compiling
---------

To regenerate the ROM, just `make bitlove.nes` should work. Requires the Ophis assembler (https://michaelcmartin.github.io/Ophis/) in your `PATH`.

Running
-------
Load the `bitlove.nes` ROM into any NES emulator and it should run.
